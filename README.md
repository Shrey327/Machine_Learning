## üìù Usage Examples

### Running a Classification Model
```python
# Example from cats vs dogs classification (in Colab)
!pip install tensorflow matplotlib

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

```

### Data Analysis Workflow
```python
# Standard Colab data analysis setup
!pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load dataset (from Drive or direct URL)
df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/your_data.csv')
# OR
df = pd.read_csv('https://your-dataset-url.com/data.csv')

# Perform analysis with interactive plots
# Generate insights
```
